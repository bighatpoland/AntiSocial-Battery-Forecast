# 🔋 Social Battery Forecast (SBF)
> "Because 'I'm busy' is a lie, but 'My internal servers are melting' is a medical fact."

## 🕵️‍♂️ Mission Objective
The **Social Battery Forecast** is a state-of-the-art Early Warning System (EWS) designed for the modern hermit. Using highly questionable AI algorithms and "Aura Recognition," we provide a predictive model of exactly when you will stop nodding politely and start fantasizing about a smoke-bomb exit.

## 🚩 Threat Assessment
This application tracks the three horsemen of the Social Apocalypse:
1.  **Eye Contact Factor**: The sheer trauma of looking someone in the iris for more than 1.5 seconds.
2.  **Small Talk Density**: A measurement of how many "How about that local sports team?" comments a human can survive before ego-death.
3.  **Mandatory Fun**: The high-intensity events (weddings, "syncs," baby showers) that serve as high-speed energy centrifuges.

## 🛠 Features
- **Aura Identification (Face ID)**: Our AI analyzes your facial micro-expressions to detect levels of "I should have stayed home."
- **Social Hazard Log**: Import your Google Calendar threats so you can visualize your impending doom in real-time.
- **Escape Plan Generation**: AI-generated excuses ranging from "My goldfish has a panic attack" to "I have a sudden allergy to fluorescent lighting."
- **The Collapse Moment**: A hyper-specific timestamp of when you will officially lose the ability to speak English.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **React 19**: For a UI smoother than your excuses to leave the party.
- **Gemini 3 Flash**: The "brain" that calculates your social demise with chilling accuracy.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Because if you're going to be socially exhausted, you should look *aesthetic* while doing it.
- **Lucide Icons**: Visual representations of the tools you'll never use because you're in bed.

## ⚠️ Known Bugs
- **The "Friend" Bug**: Occasionally, people will still invite you to things despite your battery being at 4%. This is a hardware issue with society.
- **Sunlight**: The application UI is optimized for dark rooms with closed curtains. Exposure to 10:00 AM sunlight may cause CSS flickering.
